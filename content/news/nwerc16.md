The Northwestern Europe Regional Contest (NWERC) is upon us and we are looking forward to a great event this weekend. Three teams from TUM consisting of total 9 students and their coaches have been training hard for one of our most prestigious contests of the year. The team members have been selected during various local contests and our training camp this October. They will compete for hopefully many solved problems and maybe even seats at the World Finals of the ACM ICPC.

These are the teams we send this year:

* TUMbling: Karl Kraus, Achraf Mamdouh, Kirill Martynov
* Oachkatzlschwoaf: Markus Hasenöhrl, Gregor Matl, Thomas Tangl
* TUMuchTime: Yannick Brunken, Sharru Möller, Konstantin Pervunin
* Coaches: Christian Müller, Stefan Toman

The NWERC is held annually at different locations all over Europe. This year, it takes place in Bath, UK. More information about the contest and live scoreboards can be found at http://www.nwerc.eu/. Make sure to cheer for our teams and follow our [Facebook page](https://facebook.com/IcpcTUM) for live updates!

Moreover, the NWERC is also a great opportunity for all of you that have to stay at home - you can have your own go at the problem set right from your living room. If you participate in our practical course, you can even earn bonus points to improve your grade.

So if you enjoy solving challenging problems, mark your calendars and join the fray. The online contest starts on Sunday, 20.11.2016 at 12:00 a.m. CET online at https://open.kattis.com/contests/nwerc16open and will last for 5 hours. You need to register a Kattis account to participate.
