Title: TUMjudge as a Training Platform
Description: We published all problems from our courses and our problem collection for training purposes. Also, we started a forum to discuss all our problems, contests, and lectures.

With the beginning of the summer term we want to give students who want to
prepare for ACM ICPC or other programming contests a training platform.  All
problems we wrote and collected from several contests are now available for
free at [TUMjudge contest](http://judge.in.tum.de/contest/).  All problems
have the same format and the input/output specifications are similar for all
these problems to enable you to actually solve problems instead of setting
up development environments.  If you want to be well-prepared for the GCPC
and other programming contests TUMjudge is your place to go.

You can find two types of contests there other than the training contests we
host with problems from various sources including our courses that will be
announced on our website:

* Course Problems: Problems that we wrote for our courses at TUM. Their
difficulty is given by the color of the balloon: Green is easy, yellow is
medium and red is hard.  These problems will be used in courses, thus please
do not any solutions or hints online.
* Problem Collection: Problems that we imported from numerous online
contests.  These problems are open for discussion and for many of them you
can find solutions and test data online.

For both types of contests we broke the problems down into batches of ten
problems each. The problems do not have a particular order.

To allow for better discussion of the problems and help in case of problems
we also started a discussion platform at [ICPC@TUM
Discuss](https://judge.in.tum.de/discuss/).  You can login there using your
regular TUMjudge account.  This discussion platform is there for

* help with problems from the problem collection
* lists of possible training session with the problems at TUMjudge
* articles explaining algorithms and solutions to contest problems
* discussion of news from our [website](https://icpc.tum.de)
* discussion of contests that we host
* team creation for our contests
* discussions about course related information

Please use this platform frequently to develop a vivid community. Remember
that we do not want to share information about the course problems.  We are
looking forward to meeting you at our forum and hope that you find our
problem collection useful.
