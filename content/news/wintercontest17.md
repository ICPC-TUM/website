On January 28th the ICPC group of TUM will again host a site for the annual FAU Wintercontest. Students from all departments are invited to participate! Please register as soon as possible at https://icpc.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/anmeldung.php in teams of up to three people. 

The contest starts at 10am and ends at 3pm. Please show up at least 30 minutes early for organizational remarks. After the contest sample solutions will be presented and the award ceremony takes place. This will take until approximately 4pm. Free food and drinks are provided to all participants during the contest!

Every team will work together on one computer and may use one of the following programming languages to solve the problems: C/C++, Java, and Python. Teams are allowed to bring as many books and written materiel as necessary. Electronic devices, however, are strictly prohibited.

The problems of the FAU Wintercontest are usually a bit easier than the ones of the GCPC. Hence, this contest is an outstanding opportunity to find great teammates and get accustomed to the general setup and problem style of ICPC programming contests.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to send us an email to icpc@in.tum.de in case you have any further questions or encounter any problems!

We are looking forward to meeting all of you at the contest!
