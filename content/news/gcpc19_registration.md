The German Collegiate Programming Contest 2019 takes place on **July 6th from 11am to 4pm**. This is less than a month from now! As every year, the ICPC team at TUM will host a local contest site in the computer hall at the Department of Informatics in Garching. Similar to last year, our colleagues at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg are in charge of organizing the GCPC 2019.

The registration works a bit differently than last year. You no longer need to register on the [<span style="color:darkblue">**ICPC FAU Website**</span>](https://icpc.cs.fau.de/) but can perform the registration directly through the [<span style="color:darkblue">**Baylor platform**</span>](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/finder/German-2019). This step is mandatory for participating in the GCPC 2019, so please go ahead and register as soon as possible. **The registration deadline is July 1st**.

If you are still looking for teammates, feel free to post something on the wall of our [<span style="color:darkblue">**Facebook event**</span>](https://www.facebook.com/events/488570671894011/). 

Up to today teams from more than 15 academic institutions throughout Germany are planning to participate in the GCPC 2019. If you are interested in organizing a contest site at your own university, please contact our colleagues at FAU.
