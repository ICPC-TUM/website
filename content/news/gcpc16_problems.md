The GCPC 2016 is now history and we uploaded all problems from the main
contest and the practice session to the [contest
judge](https://judge.in.tum.de/contest/).  You can solve the problems there
to get further practice.  All logins from the GCPC and all our courses work
at the judge.  The 14 problems are available in new contest as well as in
the problem collection.

Here are all files belonging to the GCPC 2016:
