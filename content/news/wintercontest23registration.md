The Winter Contest 2023 is coming! This time, we will also have an **on-site** contest like last year's GCPC. This year, CPUlm is again the main organizor of the contest. The following are the date for the contest and place of our contest site.

The Winter Contest 2023 will take place **on January 28 from 11am to 4pm**. This time, the ICPC team at TUM will host a local contest site **in the computer hall (00.05.011)** at the Department of Informatics in Garching. You can find a detailed [<span style="color:darkblue">**schedule**</span>](https://wintercontest.io/schedule) here. Please check out the exact rules on the respective [<span style="color:darkblue">**Rules website**</span>](https://wintercontest.io/rules). The [<span style="color:darkblue">**registration**</span>](https://wintercontest.io/signup) is already open and will close on January 26 at 11:59:59 CEST.

In addition to filling out the [<span style="color:darkblue">**registration**</span>](https://wintercontest.io/signup) form, you should also have an ICPC Global account. If you do not have an account on [**ICPC Global**](https://icpc.global/) yet, please go ahead and create one. Once the official registration closes, we will create your team on the ICPC Global platform, add the respective team members, and officially register you for the Winter Contest 2023.

In case you are looking for teammates or simply want to connect with the vibrant TUM competitive programming community, please fell free to join us on Discord: [https://discord.gg/ehqp6wB](https://discord.gg/ehqp6wB)

The problems of the Winter Contest are usually a bit easier than the ones of the GCPC. Hence, this contest is an outstanding opportunity to find great teammates and get accustomed to the general setup and problem style of ICPC programming contests. 

We are looking forward to seeing you all on the scoreboard of the Winter Contest!
