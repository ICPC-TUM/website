This year, we managed to hold GCPC as an onsite contest. It's great to see many of you participating in this wonderful contest this year. We had delicious pizza, snacks, and drinks during the contest. Most importantly, we had real balloons again! There are over 80 teams participating in this year's GCPC. Wa Automata was the best team from TUM and got 12th place and won a bronze medal this time, congratulations! TUMult, tunTUM, Mlou5ya, Shadow@TUM are also strong teams and had a great performance. TUM Riddle solved 12 problems and ranked first place among all teams out of competition.
