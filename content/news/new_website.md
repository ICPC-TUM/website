We relaunched our website for the winter term 2015/16. Our website at http://icpc.tum.de and all instances of TUMjudge have been ceompletely redesigned. All these websites use the same layout now and are linked through the page title at the top of each page. We also updated all TUMjudge instances to Version 5.0 which introduces many changes. Detailed information about them can be found at the changelog of each TUMjudge instance.

There are even more changes this term: We have will be using more servers now, hosting a total of 12 judgehosts. All posters were also redesigned and we introduced ICPC@TUM T-Shirts. Please contact is in case of any problems with the new design. We hope that you will enjoy our new website!
