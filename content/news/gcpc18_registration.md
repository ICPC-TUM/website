The German Collegiate Programming Contest 2018 takes place on **June 16th from 11am to 4pm**. This is less than a month from now! As every year, the ICPC team at TUM will host a local contest site in the computer hall at the Department of Informatics in Garching. While the TUM has been the main organizer of the GCPC 2016 and 2017, our colleagues at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg are in charge of the GCPC 2018.

The registration works a bit differently than in the previous years, so please pay close attention to the following. You need to first register on the official [<span style="color:darkblue">**GCPC 2018 registration website**</span>](https://icpc.cs.fau.de/anmeldung.php). A confirmation email will be sent to you immediately after having successfully signed up your team on this website. The organizers at FAU will then register your team on the Baylor platform within the next few days. You will receive an email from [<span style="color:darkblue">**icpc.baylor.edu**</span>](https://icpc.baylor.edu) requesting that you confirm this registration. This step is mandatory for participating in the GCPC 2018 so please confirm your registration on the Baylor platform immediately since you will not be able to compete otherwise. **The registration deadline is June 11th**.

If you need further team members, feel free to post something on the wall of our [<span style="color:darkblue">**Facebook event**</span>](https://www.facebook.com/events/2116950995195512/). 

Up to today teams from 12 academic institutions throughout Germany are planning to participate in the GCPC 2018. If you are interested in organizing a contest site at your own university, please contact our colleagues at FAU.
