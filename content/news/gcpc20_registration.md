Finally! After this year's German Collegiate Programming Contest has originally been postponed for obvious reason, it will now take place on **November 21th**, from 11am to 4pm, **in the internet**. GCPC is Germany's main ICPC-style contest and TUM is again hoping to win big this year!

Rules have been adapted to deal with this year's unique circumstances.
- As always, contestants participate in teams of up to 3 students.
- Teams do not have to be physically at the same location and are allowed to use the internet to communicate with each other.
- Teams are only allowed to use **one computer** for coding/debugging simultaneously. Additional machines may be used to read the problem statement and team's own code.
- Teams are allowed to copy-paste code from their cheat sheet.

Our colleagues at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg are in charge of organizing GCPC 2020. You will have to register in advance -- we will make registration details available here shortly.

If you are looking for teammates or simply want to connect with the vibrant TUM competitive programming community, please fell free to join us on Discord: https://discord.gg/ehqp6wB

Happy Coding!
