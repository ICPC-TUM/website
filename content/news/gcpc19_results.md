On Saturday, July 7th, students from all over Germany gathered at various contest sites throughout the country to participate in the German Collegiate Programming Contest 2019. This year 94 teams from 14 different academic institutions competed at 11 contest sites located in Erlangen, Göttingen, Lübeck, Karlsruhe, Kiel, Mainz, München, Potsdam, Rostock, Saarbrücken, and Ulm. Similar to the previous year, the main organizer of this year's competition was the ICPC team of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg. The programming problems were designed by a group of PhD students from various German universities (FAU, TUM, Ulm, Saarbrücken).

In order to win the contest, students not only had to find the shortest path to climb up a bouldering wall, calculate the time of music playlists and breed chameleons, they also had to analyze long-exposure black and white photographs of a spinning plane. Luckily, students were provided free pizza and snacks in order to fresh up their minds whenever they got stuck on a problem. In total the contestants faced 13 challenging programming problems that covered a wide range of algorithmic topics. The problem statement and the solution outlines can be accessed on the [<span style="color:darkblue">**official GCPC website**</span>](http://gcpc.nwerc.eu/gcpc_2019.php).

The winner of the GCPC 2019 was team "TUMbledore" from TUM who managed to solve all 13 problems. Team "<(OvO)>" from Saarland University placed 2nd, having solved 12 problems in total. The third place was awarded to the team "Let's party!" of the Karlsruher Institute of Technology who managed to solve 11 problems. Also the other TUM teams showed a remarkably strong performance. Besides team "TUMbledore", two more TUM teams finished in the top ten: team "Proof by Submission" was ranked 4th and team "\_he bes\_ \_eam in \_UM" 7th when the contest ended.
