While the Winter Contest 2021 did not take place due to the ongoing pandemic, the Winter Contest is back in 2022! In previous years, our colleagues at FAU were the main organizers of this contest. This year, the *Verein zur FÃ¶rderung des Kompetitiven Programmierens e.V.* from Ulm (also called *CPUlm*) took over the main responsibility. Our colleagues at CPUlm will also be the main organizers of the German Collegiate Programming Contest 2022 taking place later this year.

The Winter Contest will take place on Saturday, January 29 from 11am to 4pm. Similar to last year's GCPC and NWERC, the contest will be hosted online. Please check out the exact rules on the respective [<span style="color:darkblue">**Rules website**</span>](https://wintercontest.io/rules). The [<span style="color:darkblue">**registration**</span>](https://wintercontest.io/signup) is already open and will close on January 26 at 00:00:00 CET, meaning you should have registered your team by January 25.

The problems of the FAU Winter Contest are usually a bit easier than the ones of the GCPC. Hence, this contest is an outstanding opportunity to find great teammates and get accustomed to the general setup and problem style of ICPC programming contests. The problemset and solution slides of 2020 FAU Winter Contest can be found [<span style="color:darkblue">**here**</span>](https://icpc.cs.fau.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/problemset.pdf) and [<span style="color:darkblue">**here**</span>](https://icpc.cs.fau.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/solutions.pdf), respectively.

We are looking forward to seeing you all on the scoreboard of the Winter Contest!
