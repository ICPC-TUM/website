Just a few days ago, the GCPC 2016 (the German Collegiate Programming Contest) took place.
As always, many students competed at different universities spread out all over Germany.
This year saw the biggest GCPC so far with 13 organized contest sites hosting 97 teams from 16 different universities.
Also for the first time this year, the main organization of the event was done by TU Munich.

The problem set contained 13 problems and used many different topics from shortest paths to dynamic programming and three-dimensional geometry.
After a break last year, first prize went again to the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology:
The winners of GCPC 2016 were team "breaKIT" with ten solved problems, closely followed by two teams from the Universit√§t des Saarlandes.

The contest site at TU Munich hosted 35 teams with a total of about 90 students that competed for the prizes and, of course, for fun. The best team from TU Munich was team "oachkatzlschwoaf" at fourth rank with nine solved problems.
