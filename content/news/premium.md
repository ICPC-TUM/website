Today we are happy to announce the next big step for TUMjudge. We chose
today, April 1st, to announce these news since the summer term oficially
starts today.  As we enlarged our server capacities and spent the last year
coding we can announce some exciting new features.  As of the lectures of
the summer term starting April 10th you will be able to choose between
several membership levels at TUMjudge.  Here is a quick run through all the
fascinating possibilities.

We promise that the TUMjudge basic level will be free forever! An option to
purchase the new membership levels will appear on your team overview when
the summer term starts on April 10th.  Note that the membership fees apply
per team member to make up for the disadvantages of small teams during
contests.
