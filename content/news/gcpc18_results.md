On Saturday, June 16th, students from all over Germany gathered at various contest sites throughout the country to participate in the German Collegiate Programming Contest 2018. This year 123 teams from 16 different academic institutions competed at 11 contest sites located in Berlin, Dresden, Erlangen, G√∂ttingen, L√ºbeck, Kaiserslautern, Karlsruhe, Mainz, M√ºnchen, Saarbr√ºcken, and Ulm. The main organizer of this year's competition was the ICPC team of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg. As every year, the programming problems were designed by a group of PhD students from various German universities (FAU, KIT, TUM, Ulm).

In order to win the contest students not only had to find the most attractive ski route and assemble jigsaw puzzles but also solve the cable chaos in the kitchen. In total the contestants faced 13 challenging programming problems that covered a wide range of algorithmic topics. The problem statement, solution outlines, test data, as well as the jury's solutions can be accessed on the [<span style="color:darkblue">**official GCPC website**</span>](http://gcpc.nwerc.eu/gcpc_2018.php).

The winner of the GCPC 2018 was team "vO)>" from Saarbr√ºcken who managed to solve 12 out of 13 problems. Team "rootKIT üë®üë®‚Äçüíªüë®" from the Karlsruher Institute of Technology placed 2nd, having solved 11 problems in total. The best team from TUM was "infiniTUM" who placed 3rd overall and solved 10 problems. In total 26 teams from TUM participated in the GCPC 2018. Two of them were placed in the top 10; five in the top 15. Especially the head of the scoreboard was very diverse in terms of the teams' alma mater considering the fact that 8 different institutions were represented in the top 10. The final scoreboard can be found [<span style="color:darkblue">**here**</span>](http://gcpc.nwerc.eu/gcpc_2018.php).
