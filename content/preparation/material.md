# Preparation

## Yearly Contests
We host two big contests at the university every year. These are the Winter Contest at the end of January / beginning of February, and the GCPC at the end of June / beginning of July.

## Preparation Contests
Apart from these, we are regularly holding preparation contests which you can find under [preparation contests](https://judge.in.tum.de/contests/). These are completely done online, and you can participate in them without an official registration (you only need an account on the TUMjudge), alone or in a team. Usually, these contests consist of between five and eight old problems from regional rounds of the ICPC, such as the NWERC or the SWERC, or old problems from our practical course. After the contests are over, the problems remain open for submissions in a training contest.

## TUMjudge
We want to give students who want to  prepare for ACM ICPC or other
programming contests a training platform.  All problems we wrote and
collected from several contests are now available for free at [TUMjudge
contest](http://judge.in.tum.de/contest/).  They have the same format and
similar input/output specifications to enable you to actually solve problems
instead of setting up development environments.  If you want to be
well-prepared for the GCPC and other programming contests TUMjudge is your
place to go.

There you can find two further types of contests other than the preparation
contests:

* Course Problems: Problems that we wrote for our courses at TUM. Their   
difficulty is given by the color of the balloon: Green is easy, yellow is  
medium and red is hard.  These problems will be used in courses, thus please
do not any put solutions or hints online.
* Problem Collection: Problems that we imported from numerous online
contests.  These problems are open for discussion and for many of them you
can find solutions and test data online.

For both types of contests we broke the problems down into batches of ten
problems each. The problems do not have a particular order.

To allow for better discussion of the problems and help in case of
difficulties we also started a discussion platform at [ICPC@TUM
Discuss](https://judge.in.tum.de/discuss/).  You can login there using your
regular TUMjudge account.  This discussion platform is for

* help with problems from the problem collection,
* lists of possible training sessions with the problems at TUMjudge,
* articles explaining algorithms and solutions to contest problems,
* discussion about news from our [website](https://icpc.tum.de),
* discussion about contests that we host,
* team creation for our contests, and
* discussion about course related information.

Please use this platform frequently to develop a vivid community. Remember
that we do not want to share information about the course problems.  We are
looking forward to meeting you on our discussion platform and hope that you
find our problem collection useful.

## Online Problem Collections
Furthermore, there exist several collections of problems, the most prominent of which is the [UVA Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/). It offers old problem sets from a variety of contests including the regional contests and the World Finals. More information regarding the preparation can be found under [links](/preparation/links) or [courses](/preparation/courses).

## Courses
In addition, there are three different courses at the TUM which specifically deal with problems from programming contests, see [courses](/preparation/courses).
