# Preparation

## Yearly Contests
We host two big contests at the university every year. These are the Winter Contest at the end of January / beginning of February, and the GCPC at the end of June / beginning of July.

## Preparation Contests
Apart from these, we are regularly holding preparation contests which you can find under [preparation contests](/contests). These are completely done online, and you can participate in them without an official registration (you only need an account on the TUMjudge), alone or in a team. Usually, these contests consists of between five and eight old problems from regional rounds of the ICPC, such as the NWERC or the SWERC, or old problems from our practical course. After the contests are over, the problems remain open for submissions in a training contest.

## Online Problem Collections
Furthermore, there exist several collections of problems, the most prominent of which is the [UVA Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/). It offers old problem sets from a variety of contests including the regional contests and the World Finals. More information regarding the preparation can be found under [links](/preparation/links) or [courses](/preparation/courses).

## Courses
In addition, there are three different courses at the TUM which specifically deal with problems from programming contests, see [courses](/preparation/courses).
