# Participation

The current rules for the participation are set by the [ICPC rules website](http://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules). To find out if you are eligible to participate please use the [eligibility decision tree](http://icpc.baylor.edu/download/regionals/rules/EligibilityDecisionTree-2015.pdf) provided by the ICPC.

## Brief summary of rules

In order to participate at the [NWERC](http://nwerc.eu/), you have to
* be willing and capable to participate at the World Finals AND
* be enrolled in some course of the university you are competing for.

Furthermore, you are only allowed to compete for one university and cannot have participated in 
* two or more World Finals OR
* five or more Regional Contests

<script type="text/javascript">
$(function(){
  var year = new Date().getFullYear();
  $("#studystart").html(year-4);
  $("#born").html(year-23);
});
</script>

Lastly you need to 
* have started your studies no sooner than <span id='studystart'>(current year - 4)</span> OR
* be born <span id="born">(current year - 23)</span> or later.

If both or the previous conditions cannot be met you can petition the ICPC Eligibility Committee if you have not completed more than the equivalent of eight semesters of full-time study as of the date of the regional contest. Have a look at the [ICPC rules website](http://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules#HExtendingthePeriodofEligibility) for more details.
