# The ICPC

## The different rounds

The [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](http://icpc.baylor.edu/) is organized in different rounds that are held in a year's time. First one national contest decides which teams of each university are sent to the regional contest of north-west europe. The teams that are also successful in the regional contest are then sent to the World Finals.

The first ICPC contest of the year is usually the Winter Contest at the end of january / beginning of february. It is for training-purposes only.

At the end of june / early july the [German Collegiate Programming Contest (GCPC)](http://gcpc.nwerc.eu/) is held to determine the best teams at a variety of german universities including TUM. At least two teams per university are then sent to the next round - the [North Western European Regional Contest (NWERC)](http://nwerc.eu/) which is usually held at the end of november. At least two of the best teams of the NWERC are then sent to the World Finals which are usually held in the spring of the following year.

## Execution of a single round

In every round (GCPC, NWERC, World Finals) the teams usually receive 8 - 10 problems. They then have 5 hours to solve as many problems as possible. The exercises contain a mix of algorithmic as well as mathematical problems of different difficulties. Deciding which problems to work on is therefore of great importance!

## Preparation

We are regularly holding preparation contests which you can find under [prepation contests](/contests). Furthermore, there exist several collections of problem the most prominent of which is the [UVA Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org). It offers old problem sets from a variety of contests including the regional contests and the World Finals. More information regarding the preparation can be found under [links](/preparation/links) or [courses](/preparation/courses).
